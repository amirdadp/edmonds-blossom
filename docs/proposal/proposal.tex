\begin{abstract}
	Edmonds' Matching Algorithm (also known as Edmonds' Blossom Algorithm) \cite{Edmonds1965} is a classic algorithm to efficiently find a maximum matching in graph by iteratively finding augmenting path and \textit{shrinking} odd cycles as needed. The algorithm is of historic interest as it was the first algorithm to perform this operation in polynomial time. Additionally, its linear programming description was a part of Jack Edmonds' major breakthrough in combinatorial optimization \cite{Edmonds1965MA}.
	The key goal for this project is to have a functional implementation (description) of the algorithm in Rocq Prover followed by formally proving the correctness and termination of the algorithm for simple unweighted graphs. The major tasks lies in proving the \textit{preservation} of the augmenting paths when shrinking the odd cycles.
